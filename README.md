It's a project where we learn about making a simple OpenAI with lifelines, hugging face, and most importantly Langchain. If the first description doesn't fit, i guess the best way to explain it is... This is a project where we learn about LLM through/with Langchain.

Prompt engineering is key in AI, especially in natural language processing. It guides AI models to produce desired outputs like answering questions or generating summaries.

Ini adalah proyek tempat kami belajar membuat OpenAI sederhana dengan garis hidup, pelukan wajah, dan yang paling penting Langchain. Jika deskripsi pertama tidak sesuai, saya kira cara terbaik untuk menjelaskannya adalah... Ini adalah proyek di mana kita belajar tentang LLM melalui/dengan Langchain.

Rekayasa cepat adalah kunci dalam AI, terutama dalam pemrosesan bahasa alami. Ini memandu model AI untuk menghasilkan keluaran yang diinginkan seperti menajawab pertanyaan atau membuat ringkasan.

# Purposes / Tujuan
Welcome to this guided project about creating a voice assistant using OpenAI and IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed. The guided project takes you through building a virtual assistant that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the text to OpenAI’s GPT-3 model, receive a response, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user. The voice assistant will have a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and a reliable back-end using Flask.

## OpenAI
OpenAI is a research organization that aims to promote and develop friendly artificial intelligence in a way that benefits humanity as a whole. One of their key projects is GPT-3, which is a state-of-the-art natural language processing model. We will be using GPT-3 in our assistant to allow it to understand and respond to a wide range of user inputs.

IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed
IBM Watson® Speech Libraries for Embed are a set of containerized text-to-speech and speech-to-text libraries designed to offer our IBM partners greater flexibility to infuse the best of IBM Research® technology into their solutions. Now available as embeddable AI, partners gain greater capabilities to build voice transcription and voice synthesis applications more quickly and deploy them in any hybrid multicloud environment. These technologies allow the assistant to communicate with users through voice input and output.

## Voice Assistants
A virtual assistant is a program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet using natural human voice. Assistants can be used in a variety of industries, including customer service, e-commerce, and education.

Python (Flask)
Python is a popular programming language that is widely used in web development and data science. Flask is a web framework for Python that makes it easy to build web applications. We will be using Python and Flask to build the backend of our voice assistant. Python is a powerful language that is easy to learn and has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can be leveraged in projects like ours.

HTML - CSS - Javascript
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to structure content on the web. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. Javascript is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity to web pages. Together, these technologies allow us to build a visually appealing and interactive front end for our assistant. Users will be able to interact with the voice assistant through a web interface that’s built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the basics of voice assistants and their various applications
- Set up a development environment for building an assistant using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Implement speech-to-text functionality to allow the assistant to understand voice input from users
- Integrate the assistant with OpenAI’s GPT-3 model to give it a high level of intelligence and the ability to understand and respond to user requests
- Implement text-to-speech functionality to allow the assistant to communicate with users through voice output
- Combine all of the above components to create a functioning assistant that can take voice input and provide a spoken response
- (Optional) Understand how to deploy the assistant to a web server for use by a wider audience

## Prerequisites
Having knowledge of the basics of HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Python are nice to have but not essential. We will do our best in explaining each step of the process as well as any code shown along the way.
